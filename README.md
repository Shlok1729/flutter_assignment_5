An interactive and visually engaging Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator made with Flutter.  
It calculates BMI in real-time using sliders and provides instant visual and emoji feedback based on the result.

## 📐 BMI Logic Used

> **BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))²**

The app converts height from cm to meters, then calculates BMI dynamically as sliders are moved.
